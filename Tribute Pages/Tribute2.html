        <h2>Nikola Life Story</h2>
        <p>Nikola Tesla, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian
           Empire [now in Croatia]—died
           January 7, 1943, New York, New York, U.S.), Serbian American
           inventor and engineer who
            discovered and patented the rotating magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current
            machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission. He
            immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of
            alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he
            invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.
            Tesla was from a family of Serbian origin. His father was an Orthodox priest; his mother
            was unschooled but highly intelligent. As he matured, he displayed remarkable imagination
            and creativity as well as a poetic touch.
            Training for an engineering career, he attended the Technical University at Graz, Austria,
            and the University of Prague. At Graz he first saw the Gramme dynamo, which operated as a
            generator and, when reversed, became an electric motor, and he conceived a way to use alternating
            current to advantage. Later, at Budapest, he visualized the principle of the rotating magnetic
            field and developed plans for an induction motor that would become his first step toward the
            successful utilization of alternating current. In 1882 Tesla went to work in Paris for the
            Continental Edison Company, and, while on assignment to Strassburg in 1883, he constructed, after
            work hours, his first induction motor. Tesla sailed for America in 1884, arriving in New York with
            four cents in his pocket, a few of his own poems, and calculations for a flying machine. He first
            found employment with Thomas Edison, but the two inventors were far apart in background and methods,
            and their separation was inevitable.
            In May 1888 George Westinghouse, head of the Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh, bought the
            patent rights to Tesla’s polyphase system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors.
            The transaction precipitated a titanic power struggle between Edison’s direct-current systems and the
            Tesla-Westinghouse alternating-current approach, which eventually won out.</p>
